Getting started Guide for onbarding GSoC'24 prospective contributors in `openElis Global 2`.

We understand how painful it might be for new onboarding contributors to get started to `openElis Global 2` , As the project continues to evolve, it‚Äôs essential to ensure that our documentation remains up-to-date and accessible. We understand that navigating a new project can be challenging, especially for prospective contributors. Therefore, this documentation serves as a central hub for all information related to our project, making it easier for newcomers to get started.

## OpenELIS Global 2

This laboratory information management tool rewrite onto Java Spring, and with all new technology and features. Please see our [website](http://www.openelis-global.org/) for more information.

You can find more information on how to set up OpenELIS at our [docs page](http://docs.openelis-global.org/)

## Understanding Project  structure
`OpenElis uses ` uses a multirepo approach, the project is setup using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for both [backend](./src) and [legacy UI](./frontend) but the new version of imporoved UI is build on [React](https://react.dev/) .

OpenELIS Global 2 utilizes a multi-repository approach and leverages Maven for project management. Here's a breakdown of the key folders and their purposes:

* **Frontend**: Contains the new React-based user interface for administrative dashboards.

* **src**: Holds the core Java backend logic, including services, controllers, and data access objects.

* **Volumes**: Stores volume configurations for the database, NGINX server, and Tomcat.

* **Dater export**: (Git submodule) Contains the OpenELIS data store API.
* Below is the a brief explaination of needs/roles of different directories and files.

```

## Technologies and development tools.

### Technologies

OpenELIS Global 2 is built upon a robust technology stack:

* Backend: [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Frontend: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* Framework: [Spring](https://spring.io/)


### Ensuring Code Quality


We prioritize maintaining high code quality through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. OpenELIS utilizes various testing tools, including:

* JUnit 5 (https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)
* Mockito (https://site.mockito.org/)
* TestNG (https://testng.org/)
* Cypress (https://www.cypress.io/)


It is high recommended to rebuild the application and make sure your test cases are passing before opening any pull request.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with Java 11 is recommended. If you're using a different version, download Java 11 and set your JAVA_HOME environment variable accordingly.
If you are familiar with these technologies, you are ready to go üöÄ. And if not yet don't worryüßê, keep the consistency and make valuable contributions.

## Setting up the project environment.

OpenElis Grobal works well with Java 11  , if you have a different java version you can download the  [Java 11 ](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) and set your JAVA_HOME to point to 11.


## Running OpenELIS in Docker

#### Running docker compose With pre-released docker images
    docker-compose up -d

#### Running docker compose with docker images built directly from the source code
    docker-compose -f build.docker-compose.yml up -d --build

#### Running docker compose With locally compiled/built Artifacts (ie the War file and React code) For Developers
1. Fork the [OpenELIS-Global Repository](https://github.com/I-TECH-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2.git) and clone the forked repo. The `username` below is the `username` of your Github profile.

         git clone https://github.com/username/OpenELIS-Global-2.git 

2. innitialize and build sub modules

        cd OpenELIS-Global-2
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        cd dataexport
        mvn clean install -DskipTests

3.   Build the War file

            cd ..
            mvn clean install -DskipTests

4. Start the containers to mount the locally compiled artifacts

        docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d    

   Note : For Reflecting Local changes in the Running Containers ;
* Any Changes to the [Front-end](./frontend/) React Source Code  will be directly Hot Reloaded in the UI
* For changes to the [Back-end](./src/) Java Source code
    - Run the maven build again  to re-build the War file

           mvn clean install -DskipTests

    -  Recreate the Openelis webapp container

           docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d  --no-deps --force-recreate oe.openelis.org          

#### The Instaces can be accesed at

| Instance  |     URL       | credentials (user : password)|
|---------- |:-------------:|------:                       |
| Legacy UI   |  https://localhost/api/OpenELIS-Global/¬† |¬†admin: adminADMIN! |
| New React UI  |    https://localhost/  |  admin: adminADMIN!

## FAQs
- Why I get this exception when try to natively `Could not find artifact org.itech:dataexport-api:pom:0.0.0.8` trying to run my application with tomcat ?
    - Kindly make sure you have done the second setp well. You can run these commands to solve the issue.

          git submodule update --init --recursive
          cd dataexport
